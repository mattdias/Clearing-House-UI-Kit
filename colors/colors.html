Primary palette
18. The primary colour of the CBD is the characteristic green of the CBD logo. It is immediately
recognizable and should be prominent in all communications. Furthermore, in order to allow more
flexibility in expressing the Protocols and the various Programmes of Work and initiatives, the primary
palette is extended with blue and brown. Together, these three colours represent nature/Earth.

19. When converted to gray, these three colours all have the same shade: this conveys the idea that a
world without (bio)diversity is uniform and dull. In order to allow more contrast, the primary colours may
be complemented with a darker shade. The darkening coefficient is the same as the one in the logo of the
United Nations Decade on Biodiversity:

20. The secondary palette shall be used for highlighting and catching the audience’s attention. Yellow
and red are nature’s way of attracting attention. Only one secondary colour should be used at a time with
the primary colours. Note: the orange and violet are the same shade as the primary colours when
converted to grey.
